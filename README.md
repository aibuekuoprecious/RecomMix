1. **`run.py`**: This is my main entry point. When I run `python run.py`, it imports the `create_app` function from the `app` package and starts the Flask development server.

2. **`/app/__init__.py`**: This file initializes my Flask application. It creates the Flask app instance (`create_app`) and sets up the database and other configurations. It also registers the blueprint (`routes_bp`) from the `routes.py` file.

3. **`/app/routes.py`**: This file defines the routes for my application. It includes routes for serving HTML (`/`) and any other routes I might need. It imports the `create_app` instance from the `__init__.py` file and uses it to define routes.

4. **`/app/templates/index.html`**: This is an HTML file that will be served when the user accesses the root URL ("/"). It includes links to static assets like CSS and JavaScript using Flask's `url_for` function.

5. **`/app/static/css/style.css`**: This is a CSS file for styling my HTML content. It is placed in the `/static/css` directory, and it's linked in the `index.html` file.

6. **`/app/static/js/script.js`**: This is a JavaScript file that can be used for client-side scripting. Similar to the CSS file, it is placed in the `/static/js` directory and linked in the `index.html` file.

When I run my Flask application using `python run.py`, the development server starts. When I access the root URL (`http://127.0.0.1:5000/`) in my browser, Flask routes the request to the `home` function in `routes.py`, which renders the `index.html` template. The HTML file includes CSS and JavaScript from the `/static` directory.

In summary, the connections are established through imports and Flask's routing mechanism. The `run.py` script starts the Flask app, and the `routes.py` file defines how different URLs are handled. The HTML file and static assets are linked together in the templates.
